summary:   The classic brick puzzle game revisited
description: |
  Imbricker is a game based on the principle of the popular game Tetris. Imbricker is a free puzzle game where the player must complete lines by moving seven differently shaped pieces (called brickiminos) which descend onto the playing field. Brickiminos have to be fitted into each other. Once a line is completed, it disappers and the player wins points. The game ends when the playing field is filled. The longer the player can delay this inevitable outcome, the higher their score will be.
